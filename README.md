# Blog Application with Spring Boot

Welcome to the documentation for the Blog Application built using Spring Boot. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience covering various aspects of building REST APIs, securing them, implementing CRUD operations, handling exceptions, and more. Below is an overview of the key features and concepts covered in this project.

## Project Highlights

### Building REST APIs
- Develop REST APIs for a Blog App using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), and MySQL Database.
- Implement CRUD operations for Blog entities.
- Establish REST APIs for handling one-to-many & many-to-many relationships, such as `/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}`.

### Advanced Functionality
- Implement REST APIs for Pagination and Sorting.
- Build REST APIs for Search and Filtering in the Spring Boot Project.

### User Authentication

- Learn the usage of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
- Implement Spring Boot REST API Exception Handling and Validation.

### Security
- Secure REST APIs with role-based security.
- Configure JSON Web Token (JWT) for enhanced security.
- Integrate JWT with login API and secure REST APIs using JWT.

### Database Interactions
- Write query methods using Spring Data JPA.
- Explore one-to-many and many-to-many JPA/Hibernate mappings.

### Testing and Documentation
